In the electronics industry, the markup for a product is a key marketing tool used to determine how much profit a company makes off each product. 
The markup is calculated by taking the price of a product and adding a margin to it. If the total is higher than the original cost, 
the manufacturer makes money through sales. If not, they lose money. Device manufacturers use device markup to determine how much they make off each device. [url=https://www.diigo.com/item/pdf/9uc9h/05i6?k=a81d41dd07a59e403022cd6547192a94]Markup Calculator[/url]
